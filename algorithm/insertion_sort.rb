# The worst-case (and average-case) complexity of the insertion sort algorithm is O(nÂ²).
# Meaning that, in the worst case, the time taken to sort a list is proportional to the square of the number of elements in the list. 
# The best-case time complexity of insertion sort algorithm is O(n) time complexity.
